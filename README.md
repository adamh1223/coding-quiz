## Description
This coding quiz is a 90 second quiz covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After the user selects Begin Quiz, the 90 second timer begins. When the user selects an answer, they are given feedback on if their answer is correct or incorrect. The score is reflected and auto updates in the top right corner during the quiz. When the timer runs out, or the user completes all of the questions, the quiz concludes and they are taken to the high scores page. There, they are prompted to type in their initials. When they click submit, their initials appear on the page on the bottom of the list, alongside their quiz score. The scores are saved in local storage. When navigating directly to the high scores page, the user is not able to add their initials because they have not yet taken the test.
